# Global-Production-Data-Analysis
# SQL Server Database, BI and Data Visualization Project With Agile Methods
 
 # Global crop production data is collected from all countries in the world each year. You’re tasked
with data cleaning and building visualizations that can be published on the organization’s website in the
future. 
# You will use SQL Server as a DBMS and Power BI as a data visualization tool.

# This project is broken down into two parts, which correspond to two releases:
# 1. Data import and cleaning
# 2. Data Visualization

# Agile methodology will be used to implement this project. Accordingly, the project is divided into two
Releases, four Sprints and seven User stories as shown in the table below.


• In Agile Methodology, a Project has multiple Releases, with each release delivering a business
value to its customers.
• A Release contains one or more sprints.
• A Sprint, with a time boxed scope, implements one or more stories in that sprint.
• A Story, an end user driven business function may contain one or more use cases. Often in the
business, a story is interchangeably used with a use case (two terms from different generations).
A story tends to be driven more by the business user perspective whereas use cases used to
represent the system perspective.
